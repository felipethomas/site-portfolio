				<h3>Feature Oriented Programming</h3>
				<p>
					FOSD arose out of layer-based designs and levels of abstraction in network protocols and extensible database systems in the late-1980s [1]. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A program was a stack of layers. Each layer added functionality to previously composed layers and different compositions of layers produced different programs. Not surprisingly, there was a need for a compact language to express such designs. Elementary algebra fit the bill: each layer was function (program transformation) that added new code to an existing program to produce a new program, and a program's design was modeled by an expression, i.e., a composition of transformations (layers). The figure below illustrates the stacking of layers h, j, and i (where h is on the bottom and i is on the top).
